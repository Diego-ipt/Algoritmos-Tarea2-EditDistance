Once back at my typewriter later that afternoon, I wrote Donald Wandrei that something should be done to keep Lovecraft’s work in print; he replied that collecting only the stories, as I had thought to do, was not enough—all the work should be collected and eventually published, including the marvellously instructive and entertaining letters. I lost no further time in collecting and arranging the stories, which were put into typescript by my then secretary, Alice Conger, and immediately submitted to Charles Scribner’s Sons. Scribner’s were at that time my own publishers, and, while sympathetic to the project and cognizant of the literary value of Lovecraft’s fiction, rejected the manuscript because the cost of producing so bulky a book, combined with the public’s then sturdy resistance to buying short story collections and the comparative obscurity of H. P. Lovecraft as a writer, made the project financially prohibitive. Simon & Schuster, to whom the manuscript was next submitted, likewise rejected, for similar reasons.
